## Complete Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Step 1: Starting in the Antechamber

You start in the **Dusty Antechamber** with an **Unlit Torch** in your inventory.

**Commands to try:**
- `look` - Examine your surroundings
- `inventory` - Check what you're carrying (you'll see the unlit torch)
- `examine torch` - Look at your starting item

**What you'll see:**

### Step 2: Talk to the Ghostly Guide (Optional but Helpful)

The ghostly guide provides helpful hints about the puzzles ahead.

**Commands:**
- `talk to ghostly guide` or `talk to guide`

**Recommended dialogue path:**
1. Choose any initial response
2. When offered help, accept it
3. The guide will tell you: *"Fire illuminates more than just darkness. Light the brazier in the next room, and you may find what you seek."*

### Step 3: Solve the Door Bolt Puzzle

The door to the north is locked with a bolt. You need to pull the rusty lever to unlock it.

**Commands:**
- `examine rusty lever` - Learn about the lever
- `use rusty lever` or `pull lever` - This solves the door bolt puzzle

**Result:** The bolt slides back and the northern door unlocks.

### Step 4: Enter the Hall of Echoes

### Step 5: Gather Information

**Commands:**
- `examine brazier` - See the unlit stone brazier
- `take ancient scroll` - Pick up the scroll
- `examine ancient scroll` - Read the hint: *"The key to treasure lies in the flame's embrace."*

### Step 6: Solve the Lighting Puzzle

This is the key puzzle that unlocks access to the treasure room.

**Commands:**
- `use torch on brazier` or `light torch with brazier`

**What happens:**
1. Your unlit torch becomes a lit torch
2. The brazier lights up
3. A hidden compartment opens, revealing a brass key
4. The brass key appears in the room

**Commands:**
- `take brass key` - Pick up the newly revealed key

### Step 7: Enter the Treasure Room

Now that you have the brass key, you can unlock the eastern door.

**Commands:**
- `go east` - Move to the treasure room (the brass key automatically unlocks the door)

### Step 8: Collect the Golden Idol

**Commands:**
- `look` - Examine the treasure room
- `examine golden idol` - See the valuable statue
- `take golden idol` - Pick up the idol (this is essential for winning!)

### Step 9: Escape to Victory

**Commands:**
- `go up` - Move to the exit

**Victory!** You've completed the game! The win condition is met because you're in the exit room while carrying the golden idol.
